# Installation

Fellow is distributed as a Python package via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fellow/).  
You can install it on any system that has Python 3.10 or higher.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.10 or higher  
- pip (Python package manager)

You can check your Python version with:

    python --version

If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you may need to use `python3` and `pip3` instead.

---

## Install via pip

To install Fellow globally:

    pip install fellow

You can now run the `fellow` command from your terminal.

---

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Fellow is available:

    fellow --help

You should see a list of available flags and commands.

## Set Your API Key

Fellow requires an AI backend to function. Depending on which client you use, youâ€™ll need to set the appropriate API key as an environment variable.

For example:
### OpenAI:
Unix/Linux/macOS:
> export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

Windows Powershell:
> $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_key_here"


### Gemini:  
Unix/Linux/macOS:
> export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

Windows Powershell:
> $env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_key_here"

If you're using a **custom client**, refer to its documentation to see which environment variables or credentials are required.
Learn more in the [Client documentation](/fellow/clients).
