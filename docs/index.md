## Welcome to Fellow

**Fellow** is a command-line AI assistant built by developers, for developers.

Unlike most AI tools that stop at suggesting code, Fellow goes a step further:  
It *executes* tasks on your behalf. It reasons step-by-step, chooses commands from a plugin system, and edits files, generates content, or writes tests â€” autonomously.
