# Key Concepts

Fellow is built around a few foundational ideas that shape how it works and how you interact with it. Understanding these concepts will help you customize and extend it effectively.

---

## Task-Driven Execution

Everything in Fellow starts with a **task**, defined in a YAML file. This task is not just a goal â€” it's the seed for a chain of reasoning. For example:

    task: |
      Generate a README for this project

This task is injected into a system prompt, which guides the AI in choosing and executing appropriate actions step-by-step.

---

## Reasoning Loop

Fellow follows a simple but powerful loop:

1. Generate a message based on the task and current context  
2. Optionally call a function (e.g. `edit_file`, `get_code`)  
3. Execute function.
4. Log results and feed them back into the loop  
5. Repeat until the AI outputs `END` or a step limit is reached  

This enables autonomous workflows without needing to script each step.

## Plugin System: Commands

Commands are Python functions that the AI can call. Examples include:

- [create_file](docs/commands/buildin/create_file.md)
- [list_definitions](docs/commands/buildin/list_definitions.md)
- [run_pytest](docs/commands/buildin/run_pytest.md)

You can define your own custom commands or override existing ones. The AI sees these as callable tools and chooses when to use them.

Learn more in the documentation:  
[Custom Commands](docs/commands/custom/index.md)

---

## Plugin System: Clients

Fellow is not tied to a single AI provider. It uses **clients** that wrap LLM APIs.

Built-in clients:

- [OpenAI](docs/clients/openai.md)

- [Gemini](docs/clients/gemini.md)

You can implement your own by creating a new client class. Learn more in the documentation: [Custom Clients](docs/clients/custom.md)

---

## Memory

Fellow can persist a log of thoughts and actions between runs. This log (typically stored in `memory.json`) allows the assistant to remember what it did in earlier steps and avoid redundant actions.
