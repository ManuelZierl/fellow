# What is Fellow?

**Fellow** is a command-line AI assistant that doesn’t just suggest what to do — it actually does it.

Unlike conventional AI tools that output code you must manually copy and paste, Fellow is designed to run tasks autonomously. It reads your YAML configuration, reasons step-by-step, selects appropriate commands, and performs operations like editing files, generating documentation, or running tests.

It was built to solve a simple but frustrating problem: AI is helpful, but breaking your flow to shuttle data between your terminal, code editor, and ChatGPT interrupts productivity. Fellow removes that friction.

It turns your terminal into a smart assistant that understands your project context and acts with minimal human prompting.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous reasoning loop** — generates actions based on a system prompt and task
- **Plugin-based command system** — easily extendable via Python
- **YAML-defined tasks** — reproducible, editable, and version-controlled instructions
- **Persistent memory** — keeps a log of past reasoning steps and actions
- **Pluggable AI backends** — currently supports OpenAI and Gemini, with more to come ...

## Ideal Use Cases
- Automating repetitive dev tasks (e.g. test writing, scaffolding, refactoring)
- Building your own personal AI-powered CLI workflows
- Experimenting with LLM autonomy and tool use in a controlled environment

Fellow is open-source, developer-focused, and minimal by design. It's meant to be forked, extended, and remixed to suit your personal development needs.
